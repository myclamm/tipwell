## Notes

I spent a lot of time trying to make the app look halfway decent. It's surprisingly difficult to design mobile apps. One technical challenge was that sometimes XCode's error messages are difficult to make sense of. Learning the ins and outs of XCode's user interface seems like it will be a much larger task than learning Swift itself, but I want to learn!
